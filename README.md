👋 Hi there! I'm Fadi Ashraf, currently studying engineering at MESCE and recently dipping my toes into the exciting world of programming. I have a curious mind and love exploring different areas on my own, so programming seemed like a natural next step for me. While I'm not sure how long I'll be committed to software learning, I'm eager to dive deep and see where this journey takes me.

⚙️ When I'm not coding or studying, you can often find me on the football field, where I love to kick around and enjoy the beautiful game.

Feel free to join me on this learning adventure as I navigate the world of engineering and programming!
